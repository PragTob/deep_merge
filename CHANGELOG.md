## 1.0.0 (2019-03-26)

* Added the possibility to `@derive [DeepMerge.Resolver]` if you want your custom structs to also easily be deep_mergeable
* added type specs
* Changed elixir support to ~> 1.6

Considered feature complete (tm) - unless you come with great feature ideas of course ;)

## 0.2.0 (2018-07-27)

* Remove compile warnings on elixir 1.7
* Remove 1.2 from the build matrix (was getting big, should still work)

## 0.1.1 (2016-11-29)

* Remove warnings when run with elixir 1.4.0-rc.0
